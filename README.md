# Email/Sms Spam Detection Classifier
In this Project we are predicting wheather a given message or email is a spam mail or not .
We perform various kind of data cleaning and EDA & feature engineering to build some useful features from raw dataset.
After performing all stuf then apply bag of word like CountVectorizer and TidifVectorizer with some naive bayes algorithm like MultinomialNB,BernoulliNB,GaussianNB
And choose best one whose precision score and accuracy is 1.00 and 97.67 repectively.
